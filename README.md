# BAMAZON

Bamazon is a simple Node.js app I wrote that interacts with a mock database I created.
Bamazon is obviously a play on Amazon. The app takes user input with the use of Inquirer
and interacts with a database of products. It will update the database when something is 
purchased and show the user the total cost of their purchase. When users try to purchase 
too much of an item and it goes over the quantity it will give them a prompt to try again 
because of insufficient quantity. No additional functionality yet, but I'll continue to work 
on it to improve my skills with both MySQL and connecting Databases in JavaScript.

Below are some screenshots of it working, with different commands.
